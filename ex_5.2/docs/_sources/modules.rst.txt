The API describes all functionalities implemented for this exercise. Of particular interest is the :mod:`main` script, which can be used to validate an implementation (see :ref:`testing <tests-reference-label>` for how to properly verify your implementation).

The modules :mod:`lib.spiking_functions` and :mod:`lib.spiking_layer` contain the missing functionalities that have to be implemented. There is a new theory question in week 2. Don't forget to answer the theory question in the file ``theory_question.txt`` and submit the completed .txt file with your code. 

Throughout, the following notation is used:
    - :math:`U` : The membrane potential.
    - :math:`I` : The post-synaptic current.
    - :math:`S` : The spiking activity.
